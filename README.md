Savvy
=====

Savvy is a MVP framework for database-driven GUI applications written in PHP.
It is currently in an early stage of development and far from being usable in
a productive manner.

Installation
------------

1. Download core project and install dependencies:<pre>
git clone https://github.com/poliander/savvy && cd savvy && composer.phar install
</pre>

2. Make "public/" your web server document root. (Note: there is an important
   ".htaccess" file in there!)

3. For convenience, add "bin/" to your environment's PATH variable

4. Create application.ini from example configuration:<pre>
cp config/application.ini.example config/application.ini
</pre>

5. Create an empty MySQL database and customize application.ini accordingly

6. Use "doctrine-update.sh" to update database schema, generate proxy classes etc.

Source Documentation
--------------------

* generate your own API documentation in "public/doc/api/" with "savvy-api.sh"
(requires [phpDocumentor 2](http://www.phpdoc.org/))  

* same thing with "savvy-tests.sh" which uses [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/)
and Xdebug to create code coverage reports in "public/doc/tests/"  

* use [PHP_CodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer) to check
whether your code-style is compliant to PSR-2
